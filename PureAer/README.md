### Each Model will come with A Secret Key, Which you have to enter over [here](https://bumblebee-3.github.io/PureAer/login.html) to access your dashboard. DO NOT LOOSE THIS KEY!
The model checks the Carbon Dioxide levels [COâ‚‚], Carbon Monoxide levels [CO], LPG and Smoke Levels of the room. If any of them are high, It will automatically turn on the filter, as and when required, without any human intervention.
It also updates the website about the same.
